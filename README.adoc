= Rinha de Backend 2024 Q1

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/vert.x-4.5.3-purple.svg[link="https://vertx.io"]

This application is a simple implementation to the https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2024-q1/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file[rinha-de-backend-2024-q1] challenge using Kotlin and Vert.x web framework.

* #PS:# This implementation doesn't consider some good practices and patterns like clean code. It's focused in reach the requirements and pass in the stress test with the best performance possible.

== Another implementations
In each branch I'll find another implementations to solve the same problem using different approaches.

* `v1`:
** Use of `Advisory Locks` to avoid the concurrency issues of the challenge.
** A cache memory of clients id and account limits data to avoid 1 select query.
** Two tables were created, `clients` and `transactions`, and the transaction table keeps the client's `balance` data. The last transaction will hold the current client's `balance` data.
* `v2`:
** Use of `Pessimistic Locking` to avoid the concurrency issues of the challenge.
** Two tables were created, `clients` and `transactions` and each insert in transaction table is done together with an update in the client's `balance` data.
* `v3`:
** Same of `v2` but using *GraalVM* to compile the application to a native image.
* `v4`:
** This version has some performance configuration for *NGINX* and *PostgreSQL*. But it's still handling the logic and validations in the application layer and using the same database schema of the previous versions.
